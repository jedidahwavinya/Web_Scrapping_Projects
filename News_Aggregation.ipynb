Three allegations were upheld against PC Philip Neilson, including making \\\"highly racist and discriminatory remarks\\\" about different ethnic groups. Five allegations were upheld against PC Martin Borg, with the chair of the panel describing his conduct as a \\\"disgrace\\\". Both were dismissed with immediate effect. They are the first two of 10 current or former officers to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings over footage recorded during the Panorama investigation.\\n\\nDuring the hearings in south-west London on Thursday, both Mr Neilson and Mr Borg denied being racist and disputed allegations of gross misconduct, but accepted the comments aired in the programme. Chair of the panel, Cdr Jason Prins, said of both officers: \\\"It was or must have been obvious to him that the comments made were abhorrent.\\\" Mr Neilson was recorded by the BBC referring to an \\\"invasion\\\" of \\\"scum\\\" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia. He was also observed saying a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have a \\\"bullet through his head\\\". The other allegations against Mr Neilson related to \\\"glorifying what he was describing as inappropriate use of force on a restrained detainee\\\" and for suggesting unlawful violence against migrants who broke the law. Cdr Jason Prins found all the allegations proven.\\n\\nThe hearing was told that he did not dispute the words he said but argued they only amounted to just misconduct. Giving evidence, Mr Neilson said he had been a police officer for four years and denied he was a racist. He said he believed the undercover reporter \\\"breached his humans rights\\\" and it was the reporter who \\\"kept bringing up these conversations\\\" and \\\"egging me on\\\". Mr Neilson said he had eight or nine pints of Guinness while at the pub when he made some of the comments and said he was not a \\\"drinker\\\". He said he did not discriminate against anyone and footage from his body worn camera would show \\\"no matter the ethnicity I did everything with the utmost respect\\\". Cdr Prins ruled that Mr Neilson's comments caused \\\"significant harm\\\" to the reputation of Metropolitan Police and wider public confidence in the police and amounted to gross misconduct, describing the conduct of the officer as an \\\"utter disgrace\\\". The Met had previously said he had \\\"displayed extreme racial, violent and discriminatory views\\\", as well as a lack of \\\"respect, courtesy and professionalism\\\".\\n\\nPC Philip Neilson calls immigrants 'scum' in secret filming\\n\\nPC Martin Borg, who worked out of Charing Cross Police station, was also dismissed on Thursday. An undercover BBC reporter recorded Mr Borg enthusiastically describing how he saw another officer stomp on a suspect's leg in custody. The officer was filmed laughing and saying he had offered to make a statement claiming the suspect had kicked the sergeant first. It is not clear from CCTV footage seen by the BBC whether that was the case. James Berry KC, bringing the case for the Met, said the Panorama programme showed Mr Borg \\\"revelled in the use of force on detainees\\\" and made a \\\"number of discriminatory remarks about Muslims\\\".\\n\\nPC Martin Borg described seeing a colleague stamp on a detainee\",\n          \"Not guilty verdict for Soldier F in Bloody Sunday murder trial\\n\\n58 minutes ago Share Save Davy Wilson BBC News NI Share Save\\n\\nReuters Family members hold pictures of victims of the 1972 'Bloody Sunday' atrocity\\n\\nA former member of the Parachute Regiment has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday in 1972. That day 13 people were shot dead and at least 15 others injured on January 1972 at a civil rights demonstration in the Bogside area of Derry. Soldier F, whose anonymity is protected by a court order, faced charges of murdering James Wray, 22, and William McKinney, 26, as well as five charges of attempted murder. The judge said members of the Parachute Regiment had shot unarmed civilians as they ran away, but the evidence against Soldier F had fallen well short of what is required for conviction.\\n\\nJudge Patrick Lynch told Belfast Crown Court that the members of the Parachute Regiment who had entered Glenfada Park North had \\\"totally lost all sense of military discipline\\\". They had, the judge said, shot \\\"unarmed civilians fleeing from them on the streets of a British city\\\". \\\"Those responsible should hang their heads in shame,\\\" he said.\\n\\nBloody Sunday families leave court \\\"with incredible sense of pride\\\", says victim's brother\\n\\nThe public gallery was filled with the friends and families of those who were killed and injured on Bloody Sunday, with many travelling from Derry early in the morning, as well as supporters of Soldier F. Speaking outside court Mickey McKinney, whose brother William was shot dead, said the families are filled \\\"with incredible sense of pride\\\", despite the verdict. Liam Wray, whose brother Jim was also killed, said it was a \\\"tough, sad and emotional\\\" day, adding that, while \\\"justice had not been achieved\\\", he \\\"appreciated the difficulties the judge faced in the case\\\". \\\"It takes you back to the horror of [Bloody Sunday]\\\" he said. \\\"[To] The wounds Jim had, the situation, the fear, the terror.\\\"\\n\\nRelatives held held a short silence at the memorial near the spot where many of the victims from Bloody Sunday were killed\\n\\nA solicitor representing some of the Bloody Sunday families, Ciar\\u00e1n Shiels, said Soldier F was \\\"the most protected serial killer in British legal history\\\". \\\"He has enjoyed every comfort that a victim should enjoy,\\\" he added. The Bloody Sunday relatives who travelled to Belfast for the verdict arrived back to Derry's Bogside on Thursday afternoon. They held a short silence at the memorial near the spot where many of the victims were killed 53 years ago.\\n\\n\\\"I hope this brings this process to an end,\\\" said Veterans Commissioner David Johnstone\\n\\nNorthern Ireland's veterans' commissioner David Johnstone said the trial had brought into focus the \\\"deep pain\\\" events of 50 years ago still cause. He said the Bloody Sunday families and all families who lost relatives in the Troubles, \\\"continue to experience pain\\\", adding \\\"we should not forget that today\\\". Speaking outside court, Paul Young, of the Northern Ireland Veterans' Movement, said soldiers who served in Northern Ireland with \\\"honour and courage\\\" had been \\\"hounded\\\", but added they would be \\\"heartened\\\" by the verdicts. BACKGROUND: What happened on Bloody Sunday?\\n\\nTHE STATE OF US: Soldier F not guilty\\n\\n'Legal and evidential issues'\\n\\nThe case had presented \\\"complex legal and evidential issues\\\", according to the director of public prosecutions in Northern Ireland. Stephen Herron said those \\\"difficulties have been recognised by the courts\\\" previously in regards to decisions over who to prosecute in regards Bloody Sunday. He added: \\\"Our thoughts today are foremost with the Wray and McKinney families, those who were wounded, and the loved ones of all killed and injured on Bloody Sunday.\\\"\\n\\nBloody Sunday families and supporters walked to the Royal Courts of Justice on Thursday ahead of the verdict\\n\\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was \\\"deeply disappointing\\\" that the Bloody Sunday families faced a \\\"continued denial of justice\\\". \\\"For more than five decades, they have campaigned with dignity and resilience for justice for their loved ones, their deeply cherished sons and fathers, uncles and brothers,\\\" the Sinn F\\u00e9in deputy leader said. \\\"I extend my full solidarity to the families and to the wider community of Derry who will be hurting today.\\\"\\n\\nFoyle Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Colum Eastwood said it was a \\\"difficult day\\\" for the Bloody Sunday families, but said they could \\\"hold their heads up high\\\". \\\"It is absolutely clear that those soldiers, including Soldier F, shot and killed people on Bloody Sunday,\\\" Eastwood said. \\\"These were innocent people, no weapons, just on a civil rights march, mowed down by the Parachute Regiment of the British Army. That's what happened and that's absolutely clear.\\\" He added: \\\"Everybody knows the victims were innocent and everybody knows where the guilt actually lies.\\\"\\n\\nSoldier F was found not guilty of murdering James Wray (left) and William McKinney\\n\\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson welcomed the \\\"common sense judgement\\\", but said the trial had been \\\"a painful and protracted process\\\". \\\"There needs to be a better way of dealing with the legacy of the past and to ensure no rewriting of it,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe government said it noted Thursday's judgement, adding the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had \\\"provided legal and welfare support throughout\\\". \\\"We are committed to finding a way forward that acknowledges the past, whilst supporting those who served their country during an incredibly difficult period in Northern Ireland's history,\\\" a spokesperson said.\\n\\nWho is Soldier F?\",\n          \"A Cuban man deported by the Trump administration to the southern African country of Eswatini has started a hunger strike against his detention there, his lawyer said on Wednesday.\\n\\nRoberto Mosquera del Peral was among five third-country nationals deported from the US to Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, in July.\\n\\nThey have been held in a maximum-security prison along with 10 others deported in October, after a broader ramp-up in third-country removals under the US president\\u2019s immigration crackdown.\\n\\nUS officials have said the men deported to Eswatini are convicted criminals. Their lawyers say all of them had finished serving their sentences in the US and that there was no legal basis to imprison them again.\\n\\n\\u201cMy client is arbitrarily detained and now his life is on the line,\\u201d Alma David, Mosquera del Peral\\u2019s US-based attorney, said in a statement, adding that had begun the hunger strike on 15 October.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Eswatini\\u2019s correctional services department had no immediate comment but said he would review the information.\\n\\nThe US Department of Homeland Security wrote on X in June that Mosquera del Peral, 58, had been arrested by immigration authorities in Miami. It said his criminal history included convictions for homicide, aggravated assault on a police officer and aggravated battery.\\n\\nHis attorney David said this was incorrect. She said he had been convicted of attempted murder, not murder, and had finished his sentence before he was deported. She demanded that he be permitted to meet his lawyer in Eswatini.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Headlines US Free newsletter Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.
