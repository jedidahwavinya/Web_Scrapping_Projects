Two Metropolitan Police officers have been sacked for gross misconduct after appearing in an undercover report by BBC Panorama. Three allegations were upheld against PC Philip Neilson, including making ""highly racist and discriminatory remarks"" about different ethnic groups. Five allegations were upheld against PC Martin Borg, with the chair of the panel describing his conduct as a ""disgrace"". Both were dismissed with immediate effect. They are the first two of 10 current or former officers to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings over footage recorded during the Panorama investigation.

During the hearings in south-west London on Thursday, both Mr Neilson and Mr Borg denied being racist and disputed allegations of gross misconduct, but accepted the comments aired in the programme. Chair of the panel, Cdr Jason Prins, said of both officers: ""It was or must have been obvious to him that the comments made were abhorrent."" Mr Neilson was recorded by the BBC referring to an ""invasion"" of ""scum"" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia. He was also observed saying a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have a ""bullet through his head"". The other allegations against Mr Neilson related to ""glorifying what he was describing as inappropriate use of force on a restrained detainee"" and for suggesting unlawful violence against migrants who broke the law. Cdr Jason Prins found all the allegations proven.

The hearing was told that he did not dispute the words he said but argued they only amounted to just misconduct. Giving evidence, Mr Neilson said he had been a police officer for four years and denied he was a racist. He said he believed the undercover reporter ""breached his humans rights"" and it was the reporter who ""kept bringing up these conversations"" and ""egging me on"". Mr Neilson said he had eight or nine pints of Guinness while at the pub when he made some of the comments and said he was not a ""drinker"". He said he did not discriminate against anyone and footage from his body worn camera would show ""no matter the ethnicity I did everything with the utmost respect"". Cdr Prins ruled that Mr Neilson's comments caused ""significant harm"" to the reputation of Metropolitan Police and wider public confidence in the police and amounted to gross misconduct, describing the conduct of the officer as an ""utter disgrace"". The Met had previously said he had ""displayed extreme racial, violent and discriminatory views"", as well as a lack of ""respect, courtesy and professionalism"".

PC Martin Borg, who worked out of Charing Cross Police station, was also dismissed on Thursday. An undercover BBC reporter recorded Mr Borg enthusiastically describing how he saw another officer stomp on a suspect's leg in custody. The officer was filmed laughing and saying he had offered to make a statement claiming the suspect had kicked the sergeant first. It is not clear from CCTV footage seen by the BBC whether that was the case. James Berry KC, bringing the case for the Met, said the Panorama programme showed Mr Borg ""revelled in the use of force on detainees"" and made a ""number of discriminatory remarks about Muslims"".

A former member of the Parachute Regiment has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday in 1972. That day 13 people were shot dead and at least 15 others injured on January 1972 at a civil rights demonstration in the Bogside area of Derry. Soldier F, whose anonymity is protected by a court order, faced charges of murdering James Wray, 22, and William McKinney, 26, as well as five charges of attempted murder. The judge said members of the Parachute Regiment had shot unarmed civilians as they ran away, but the evidence against Soldier F had fallen well short of what is required for conviction.

Judge Patrick Lynch told Belfast Crown Court that the members of the Parachute Regiment who had entered Glenfada Park North had ""totally lost all sense of military discipline"". They had, the judge said, shot ""unarmed civilians fleeing from them on the streets of a British city"". ""Those responsible should hang their heads in shame,"" he said.

Bloody Sunday families leave court ""with incredible sense of pride"", says victim's brother

The public gallery was filled with the friends and families of those who were killed and injured on Bloody Sunday, with many travelling from Derry early in the morning, as well as supporters of Soldier F. Speaking outside court Mickey McKinney, whose brother William was shot dead, said the families are filled ""with incredible sense of pride"", despite the verdict. Liam Wray, whose brother Jim was also killed, said it was a ""tough, sad and emotional"" day, adding that, while ""justice had not been achieved"", he ""appreciated the difficulties the judge faced in the case"". ""It takes you back to the horror of [Bloody Sunday]"" he said. ""[To] The wounds Jim had, the situation, the fear, the terror.""

Relatives held held a short silence at the memorial near the spot where many of the victims from Bloody Sunday were killed

A solicitor representing some of the Bloody Sunday families, Ciarán Shiels, said Soldier F was ""the most protected serial killer in British legal history"". ""He has enjoyed every comfort that a victim should enjoy,"" he added. The Bloody Sunday relatives who travelled to Belfast for the verdict arrived back to Derry's Bogside on Thursday afternoon. They held a short silence at the memorial near the spot where many of the victims were killed 53 years ago.

""I hope this brings this process to an end,"" said Veterans Commissioner David Johnstone

Northern Ireland's veterans' commissioner David Johnstone said the trial had brought into focus the ""deep pain"" events of 50 years ago still cause. He said the Bloody Sunday families and all families who lost relatives in the Troubles, ""continue to experience pain"", adding ""we should not forget that today"". Speaking outside court, Paul Young, of the Northern Ireland Veterans' Movement, said soldiers who served in Northern Ireland with ""honour and courage"" had been ""hounded"", but added they would be ""heartened"" by the verdicts. BACKGROUND: What happened on Bloody Sunday?

THE STATE OF US: Soldier F not guilty

'Legal and evidential issues'

The case had presented ""complex legal and evidential issues"", according to the director of public prosecutions in Northern Ireland. Stephen Herron said those ""difficulties have been recognised by the courts"" previously in regards to decisions over who to prosecute in regards Bloody Sunday. He added: ""Our thoughts today are foremost with the Wray and McKinney families, those who were wounded, and the loved ones of all killed and injured on Bloody Sunday.""

Bloody Sunday families and supporters walked to the Royal Courts of Justice on Thursday ahead of the verdict

First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""deeply disappointing"" that the Bloody Sunday families faced a ""continued denial of justice"". ""For more than five decades, they have campaigned with dignity and resilience for justice for their loved ones, their deeply cherished sons and fathers, uncles and brothers,"" the Sinn Féin deputy leader said. ""I extend my full solidarity to the families and to the wider community of Derry who will be hurting today.""

Foyle Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Colum Eastwood said it was a ""difficult day"" for the Bloody Sunday families, but said they could ""hold their heads up high"". ""It is absolutely clear that those soldiers, including Soldier F, shot and killed people on Bloody Sunday,"" Eastwood said. ""These were innocent people, no weapons, just on a civil rights march, mowed down by the Parachute Regiment of the British Army. That's what happened and that's absolutely clear."" He added: ""Everybody knows the victims were innocent and everybody knows where the guilt actually lies.""

Soldier F was found not guilty of murdering James Wray (left) and William McKinney

Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson welcomed the ""common sense judgement"", but said the trial had been ""a painful and protracted process"". ""There needs to be a better way of dealing with the legacy of the past and to ensure no rewriting of it,"" he said.

The government said it noted Thursday's judgement, adding the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had ""provided legal and welfare support throughout"". ""We are committed to finding a way forward that acknowledges the past, whilst supporting those who served their country during an incredibly difficult period in Northern Ireland's history,"" a spokesperson said.

Multiple sources in government are making it clear there is a widespread determination - from No10 to the Home Office - to keep the Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips in post. Phillips has come under sustained pressure after four members of the survivors panel of the grooming gang inquiry quit and said they would only re-join it if the minister was replaced. Since then, another five abuse survivors have written to the prime minister to say they will only continue to work with the inquiry if Jess Phillips keeps her job. There were, originally, 30 people on the panel the BBC understands - more than has been previously reported.

The government is expecting it to be months before they appoint a chair of the inquiry. The process was thrown into chaos when the leading candidate ministers hoped to appoint, former Northern Ireland police officer and child abuse expert Jim Gamble, said he was not interested in the job. Sources say they are ""taking urgent steps to ensure a new candidate is found"". ""The government will now re-engage with the victims and survivors - to listen to their concerns and take their opinions on the type of person they want to lead the inquiry,"" the BBC was told. We ""will move as fast as possible, but must also take the time, likely months, to appoint the right chair,"" a source added. Sir Keir announced a national inquiry into the sexual exploitation of children by grooming gangs in England and Wales in June. The PM said the inquiry would have the power to compel witnesses to be questioned and would be guided by a panel of survivors, which the BBC understands had at least 20 members at the start. But there has been turmoil over the past week, with Fiona Goddard and Ellie Reynolds quitting the survivors panel in the inquiry on Monday, and two more known as ""Elizabeth"" and ""Jess"" following them on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

Senior figures in government are acutely aware that the victims of sexual abuse have been repeatedly and profoundly let down by multiple agencies of the state – and so establishing trust is incredibly difficult. ""Upset and vulnerable people hit out when they are in pain, and that is entirely understandable,"" one figure told the BBC. The panel members, we are told, are of a range of views and instincts – on their willingness or not to speak out, on their views on those who chose to do so or not, and on who should chair the inquiry and how it should be run.

The issue was raised at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, when Sir Keir invited the four who had quit to re-join and sought to reassure them that ""I want to get this right"", despite the difficulties when ""every survivor does bring their own painful experience to this"". ""The inquiry is not and will never be watered down. Its scope will not change. It will examine the ethnicity and religion of the offenders and we will find the right person to chair the inquiry,"" he told MPs. However, there was still palpable fury from the group, who penned a group letter calling for Phillips to resign because she had broken a fragile trust. Now, a second group of survivors, headed by Samantha Walker-Roberts, has written to Sir Keir and Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood with a list of seven conditions for their continued support, including Phillips continuing in her role. ""Jess Phillips has remained impartial to the process, only listening to feedback [and] we want her to remain in position for the duration of the process for consistency,"" they wrote. ""Her previous experience and drive to reduce VAWG [violence against women and girls] and her clear passion and commitment is important to us."" They praised Phillips, who they said had ""devoted her life to hearing and amplifying the voices of women and girls who would otherwise have been unheard"" and had helped some of them access support. Earlier today, the first group called on Phillips to quit in order to restore trust in the inquiry, accusing her of ""betrayal"" for describing reports the scope of the inquiry could be widened as ""untrue"". Headed up by Fiona Goddard, the group of four said they would only re-join it if the minister went, because they had ""raised legitimate concerns around the inquiry's direction"" but ""in response, your safeguarding minister, Jess Phillips called our accounts untrue"". Another survivor, known as Carly, from Huddersfield, told the BBC she wanted to remain part of the inquiry, but she also believes Phillips should go, because ""she can't lie about what we all know"" around the question of whether to widen the inquiry's scope.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ca07/live/321d61b0-b01a-11f0-a6e4-031e2de4ddc5.png

Watch: Claudia and Tess announce they're leaving Strictly Come Dancing

Strictly Come Dancing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman are to leave the show. ""We have loved working as a duo and hosting Strictly has been an absolute dream. We were always going to leave together and now feels like the right time,"" the pair wrote in a joint statement on Instagram. ""We will have the greatest rest of this amazing series and we just want to say an enormous thank you to the BBC and to every single person who works on the show."" The BBC said their final appearance would come on this year's Christmas special show on 25 December.

Daly has presented since the first series 21 years ago. Winkleman joined in 2014, having hosted Strictly's sister show It Takes Two since 2004. ""We will cry when we say the last 'keep dancing' but we will continue to say it to each other,"" said the duo. ""Just possibly in tracksuit bottoms at home while holding some pizza."" Commenting on the announcement, judge Craig Revel Horwood simply said: ""It will never be the same."" His fellow judge Motsi Mabuse wrote underneath Winkleman's instagram post: ""Going to miss you so much! ""You're an icon and inspiration. Still in shock, but wishing you love and best wishes."" Former It Takes Two presenter and Strictly contestant Zoe Ball added: ""Absolute class act. Bravo ladies. Huge love."" One of the BBC's highest-rated shows, Strictly Come Dancing launched in 2004. It was originally hosted by Daly and Sir Bruce Forsyth, who stepped down in 2014.

Describing her 21 years on the show, Daly said it was ""hard to put into words"" what the experience had meant to her. ""Strictly has been more than just a television programme. It's felt like having a third child, a second family, and a huge part of my life since that very first show. ""I knew then it was something special, but I could never have imagined the magic it would bring."" She also paid tribute to ""the incomparable Sir Bruce Forsyth"", saying: ""Brucie set the tone for everything that Strictly became: warmth, wit, connection, and pure showbiz magic."" Winkleman, who also hosts Celebrity Traitors, added: ""Strictly is a magical, glittery, fake-tanned train and it's been a privilege to be a tiny part of it. ""It has been my everything, the show I will be eternally grateful for. ""I will never forget Len Goodman trying to teach me what a cucaracha is (I still don't know) and the complete thrill and honour it was to work with Tess on the results show to co-hosting on Saturday nights.""

BBC/PA Media Strictly's current judges are Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke

Winkleman and Daly were prime-time Saturday night TV's first female presenting duo. Motsi Mabuse's sister Oti, who was a dancer on the show for seven years until 2022, called their departure ""devastating"". She thanked them for ""all the beautiful memories, for representing female presenters, being iconic, the laughs and years of family you've given all us"". DJ, broadcaster and former contestant Clara Amfo added: ""This is quite surreal. Salute to you both, [it] shouldn't be radical for two women to present prime TV together, you two do it with such genuine joy towards each other. Big respect!"" Presenter Rylan Clarke simply said ""adore you both"", while presenter and former contestant Angela Scanlon posted on Winkleman's Instagram: ""Claud - an absolute legend, effortless, hilarious, quick as a whip and beautifully tender when legs are flailing xx you will be SO MISSED."" Winkleman and Daly also referenced the off-screen friendship they've built up over the last two decades. ""Tess - I'm so so lucky I got to stand next to you. You're funny, kind, whip smart and a true friend and I love you,"" Winkleman said. Daly added: ""To my beloved Claud - what an absolute joy and pleasure it has been sharing this adventure with you. ""You're one of a kind, and I'll treasure every giggle, every live show, and every backstage moment we've shared. I'm so grateful to have you as my friend for life."" The pair also completed an ""agonising"" 24-hour danceathon in 2019 for comic Relief, raising more than £1m by dancing non-stop for 24 hours and five minutes.

Both women described the ""joy"" of presenting the show

Speaking about her decision to leave, Winkleman said she had always believed ""it's best to leave a party before you're fully ready to go"". ""I know the new hosts will be magnificent, I look forward to watching them take Strictly to new heights."" Daly added: ""This isn't a goodbye to glitter, sequins, or Saturday night sparkle (I could never say goodbye to those!). Strictly will forever hold a special place in my heart - but it does feel like the right time to hand over the reins."" Calling Strictly ""one of the greatest joys and privileges of my career"", she thanked the show's audience, saying: ""Your love, loyalty, and unwavering support have meant the world. ""You've carried us through every series, and that has never, ever been taken for granted. ""You are the heart of this show, and I feel so lucky to have shared it with you.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ce9b/live/1b3db160-affd-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg

BBC

The Israeli military is exerting control over more of Gaza than expected from the ceasefire deal with Hamas, a BBC Verify analysis has found. Under the first stage of the deal, Israel agreed to retreat to a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. The divide was marked by a yellow line on maps released by the military and has become known as the ""Yellow Line"". But new videos and satellite images show that markers placed by Israeli troops in two areas to mark the divide have been positioned hundreds of metres deeper inside the strip than the expected withdrawal line. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz - who instructed troops to place the yellow blocks as markers - warned that anyone crossing the line ""will be met with fire"". There have already been at least two deadly incidents near the boundary line.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not address the allegations when approached by BBC Verify, stating simply that: ""IDF troops under the Southern Command have begun marking the Yellow Line in the Gaza Strip to establish tactical clarity on the ground."" There has been a consistent lack of clarity as to where exactly the boundary will be imposed, with three separate maps posted by the White House, Donald Trump and the Israeli military in the run up to the ceasefire agreement which came into force on 10 October. On 14 October the IDF issued the latest version marking the Yellow Line on their online map, which is used to communicate its position to people in Gaza. But in the north, near the al-Atatra neighbourhood, drone footage from the IDF showed that a line of six yellow blocks were up to 520m further inside the Strip than would have been expected from the IDF maps. Footage geolocated by BBC Verify showed workers using bulldozers and diggers to move the heavy yellow blocks and place them along the coastal al-Rashid road.

A similar situation was visible in southern Gaza, where a satellite image taken on 19 October showed 10 markers erected near the city of Khan Younis. The line of blocks ranges between 180m-290m inside the Yellow Line set out by the IDF. If these two sections of boundary were typical of how the markers were being placed along the entirety of the line then Israel would be exerting control over a notably larger area than expected from the ceasefire agreement.

Multiple analysts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the blocks were intended to create a ""buffer zone"" between Palestinians and IDF personnel. One expert said the move would be consistent with a long-term ""strategic culture"" which seeks to insulate Israel from nearby territories it does not fully control. ""This gives the IDF space to manoeuvre and create a 'kill zone' against potential targets,"" Dr Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London, said. ""Potential targets can be engaged before they reach the IDF perimeter. It is a bit like no man's land that does not belong to anyone – and Israel tends to take that territory from the opponent's chunk not its own."" Three experts who spoke to BBC Verify suggested that the disparity between the markers and the IDF map was an intentional design to warn civilians they are ""approaching an area of increased risk"". Noam Ostfeld, an analyst with the risk consultancy Sibylline, said that some blocks ""seem to be positioned near roads or walls, making them easier to spot"". But a post to X by the Israeli defense minister seemed to suggest that the yellow blocks marked the actual line, warning that ""any violation or attempt to cross the line will be met with fire"".

There is already confusion among Gazans over areas where it is safe to go. Abdel Qader Ayman Bakr, who lives near the temporary boundary in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shejaiya district, told the BBC that, despite promises from Israel of clear markings, he had seen none put in place. ""Each day, we can see Israeli military vehicles and soldiers at a relatively close distance, yet we have no way of knowing whether we are in what is considered a 'safe zone' or 'an active danger zone',"" he said. ""We are constantly exposed to danger, especially since we are forced to remain here because this is where our home once stood."" Since the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF has reported a number of instances of people crossing the Yellow Line. On all occasions the IDF said it fired upon those involved. BBC Verify has obtained and geolocated footage showing the aftermath of one incident on 17 October, which the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said killed 11 civilians - including women and children all reportedly from the same family. The agency said the Palestinians' vehicle was targeted by Israel after crossing the Yellow Line east of Gaza City in the Zeitoun neighbourhood. The footage showed rescue workers inspecting the burnt out remnants of a vehicle and covering a nearby badly-mangled body of a child with a white sheet. BBC Verify geolocated the video to a spot around 125m over the Yellow Line marked on maps by the IDF. The IDF said warning shots were fired towards a ""suspicious vehicle"" that had crossed the line. The statement added when the vehicle failed to stop troops opened fire ""to remove the threat"".

Roberto Mosquera del Peral was among five third-country nationals deported from the US to Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, in July.

They have been held in a maximum-security prison along with 10 others deported in October, after a broader ramp-up in third-country removals under the US president’s immigration crackdown.

US officials have said the men deported to Eswatini are convicted criminals. Their lawyers say all of them had finished serving their sentences in the US and that there was no legal basis to imprison them again.

“My client is arbitrarily detained and now his life is on the line,” Alma David, Mosquera del Peral’s US-based attorney, said in a statement, adding that had begun the hunger strike on 15 October.

A spokesperson for Eswatini’s correctional services department had no immediate comment but said he would review the information.

The US Department of Homeland Security wrote on X in June that Mosquera del Peral, 58, had been arrested by immigration authorities in Miami. It said his criminal history included convictions for homicide, aggravated assault on a police officer and aggravated battery.

His attorney David said this was incorrect. She said he had been convicted of attempted murder, not murder, and had finished his sentence before he was deported. She demanded that he be permitted to meet his lawyer in Eswatini.

Gareth Jenkins, of Malaria No More UK, said: “Cutting funding risks the deadliest resurgence we’ve ever seen.”

Analysts said the cost to sub-Saharan Africa would be substantial, and the region’s leaders have appealed to the G7 to maintain investment. They have also asked the private sector and high-net worth individuals to step in, saying better control of the disease would fuel economic growth and trade.

The report estimated the impact of funding cuts to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria – which is seeking donations to cover costs from 2027 to 2029. The fund provides nearly 60% of all international financing for malaria controls, such as mosquito nets and preventive drugs.

If funding was 20% lower than in the last round, researchers said there would be an additional 33 million cases and 82,000 deaths, and $5.14bn (£3.83bn) in lost GDP by 2030, according to the report.

However, funding cuts look likely. Germany pledged $1bn to the fund last week, a figure 23% lower than its last promise. The UK government is reportedly looking at a figure 20% down on its previous commitment, although it says no final decision has been made.

If a funding vacuum led to preventive malaria control collapsing entirely, the report estimates there would be 525 million more cases, 990,000 more deaths and $83bn in lost GDP. About 750,000 of those deaths would be of children under five, representing “the loss of a generation to malaria”, the report’s authors warned.

Conversely, they said that if the Global Fund received the full $18bn it was asking for, there would be a $230bn boost to GDP, 865 million fewer cases and 1.86 million fewer deaths.

Phumaphi said there had been “marked increases in [domestic] budget allocation not just to health, but specifically to malaria, particularly since the beginning of this year.

But she added: “I think we need to appreciate the enormity of the challenge and exactly how much is required in funding in order for countries to be able to catch up.”

African countries heavily burdened by servicing debt and the economic aftershocks of Covid-19 were facing not only infectious diseases but also a growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer, she said.

It was worrying, Phumaphi said, that donor countries were considering pledging less than in the last round, “but we are grateful that countries like Germany have pledged substantial amounts – a billion is quite a substantial amount.”

The former Botswana health minister said she was hopeful that wealthy individuals, the private sector and foundations would step up “because when we talk about productivity, jobs [and the] economic potential that Africa tends to lose, we are talking about potential investments and markets for the private sector”.

One of those individuals, the Nigerian businessman Aliko Dangote, encouraged others to join him in filling the funding gap: “Malaria is not just a health crisis; it is an $83bn brake on Africa’s growth and enterprise. Business cannot thrive in sick communities.”

Malaria’s impact on GDP was measured using factors including disrupted schooling, employee absences, and the impact on tourism and agriculture.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9bf5a9dc9b420cf2bddfd124e9a9d5c543fea4/720_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5f34924f4d668681e82163c4b6f5203b"

The appearance in recent years of several new bridges in west Africa’s second most populous city has been hailed by the president’s supporters as symbolic of an era of modernity and stable leadership under his watch.

Infrastructure building has ramped up around the country and the economy has grown rapidly since Ouattara first took office in 2011 – proof, his camp says, that decades of violent crises have been left in the past.

A sense of deja vu

On a Saturday earlier this month more than 200 protesters were teargassed and arrested across Abidjan, including in neighbourhoods within a mile of the bridge opened by Ouattara two years earlier.

It was the latest in a series of demonstrations by young people against Ouattara’s decision to run for a fourth term in the presidential election taking place on 25 October.

All protests have now been banned by the government.

In another sign of a crackdown on free speech and dissenting voices, leaders of two opposition parties alleged that security personnel ransacked their homes this month, without a search warrant.

“These elections can be won without bloodshed,” said the main opposition candidate, Simone Ehivet Gbagbo. Gbagbo, Ivory Coast’s first lady from 2000 to 2011 when she was married to the former president Laurent Gbagbo, was once known to her supporters as “the Hillary Clinton of the tropics”. Others gave her the nickname “the iron lady” due to her tough reputation.

“The right solution is not to march or boycott,” she said. “The right solution is to vote.”

For older citizens, there is a sense of deja vu: Ouattara, 83, is almost the same age as his mentor Félix Houphouët-Boigny – the country’s first president – was when an uprising in 1990 led to the country’s first multiparty elections.

In July, he confirmed what people everywhere from roadside maquis (open-air restaurants) to diplomatic dinners had suspected: he was standing for yet another term. In 2020 he reached the same decision, initially declining to run for a third term but changing his mind when his party’s designated candidate died during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that a 2016 constitutional amendment had reset the clock. The main opposition boycotted the vote and Ouattara won a controversial victory.

More controversy beckons when the country goes to the polls on Saturday.

Two leading opposition figures have been sidelined. Laurent Gbagbo, now 80, is entangled in a past legal conviction linked to the 2010-11 post-electoral conflict. The former Credit Suisse banker Tidjane Thiam, 63, was disqualified after a court ruled he was a French national when he registered to contest, in contravention of Ivorian laws.

Ouattara will face an array of lesser-heralded contenders including Simone Gbagbo and three former ministers.

There are rumours about his health and claims that some of the elite – used to the trappings of power – are encouraging him to stay on. Nevertheless some supporters have called on him to step down to make way for a new generation.

In June, the front-page headline in the weekly Le Sursaut carried a plea from a self-described “allassaniste”: “Dear Papa Ouattara, don’t be a candidate.”

The communication minister, Amadou Coulibaly, brushed off any criticism. “The president is exercising his legal right under the constitution,” he told the Guardian. “He meets all criteria. Citizens are free to vote for or against him. That is democracy.”

Disinformation and disenfranchisement

Officials claim the nationwide infrastructure drive, including a rural electrification programme, has transformed many parts of the country and raised the standard of living.

“This government is committed to fighting poverty,” said Coulibaly. “In 2011, the poverty rate was 55%. In 2024, it dropped to 37%. Our goal for 2030 is to halve that again to around 18%.”

However, the cost of living has soared, especially in Abidjan, inequality levels remain high, and the average life expectancy is only 59.

“A beautiful Ivory Coast with roads is good, but happy Ivorians are better … Ivorians are not happy,” Simone Gbagbo said after a rally in the central city of Gagnoa. “It is important that if we do politics, it is for the people.”

While Ouattara remains a beloved figure in the north and parts of the centre, his approval ratings have plummeted in Abidjan. France, te former colonial ruler, has become public enemy No 1 in the region, and Ouattara, like his Nigerian counterpart, Bola Tinubu, is seen as a Parisian puppet and adversary of the newly formed Alliance of Sahel States.

That perception has been fuelled by a deluge of disinformation, including fake rumours of a coup d’etat earlier this year, that analysts say fits a pattern.

“Most of the campaigns, most of the fake news we’ve observed, come mainly from Burkina Faso,” said Vanessa Manessong, a data analyst at Code4Africa and the African Digital Democracy Observatory. She said the accounts were often pro-Russia and anti-France, and sought to discredit France and sabotage its relations with Ivory Coast.

Ouattara’s popularity dipped more after the treatment of Thiam, who leads a party founded by his great-uncle, Houphouët-Boigny. Thiam’s disqualification is seen as continuing the exclusionary identity politics that has plagued Ivory Coast for decades and was a major factor in the civil wars of 2002 to 2007 and 2010-11.

A tense situation

Ahead of the election, things are tense: more than 44,000 security personnel have been deployed nationwide. Diplomats and some expatriates are sending their families abroad briefly.

In October last year, the influential Student Federation of Ivory Coast, which has allegedly been involved in organised crime since it was established during the 1990 uprisings, was banned after two student murders and caches of weapons were found. There are fears that the group’s many factions could intervene to support their preferred candidates.

Ouattara’s rivals have called for daily protests, hoping for an audit of the electoral register and reinstatement of their leaders.

Coulibaly dismissed concerns of possible voter apathy if the disbarred candidates were not reinserted. “It’s everywhere in the world that people are losing interest in elections … so I don’t want people to stigmatise our continent,” he said. “There’s a global kind of democratic fatigue.”

On a recent trip across one of Abidjan’s new bridges, Kouakou, a taxi driver who asked for his last name not to be used, said he was glad his compatriots were taking to the streets, but that he had resigned himself to another Ouattara victory.

“It’s like an episode of 24,” said Kouakou. “You know Jack Bauer will win but you don’t know what happens before then.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c986a132549523710d707d11190b5ba9fb5e5d87/791_0_5271_4217/master/5271.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3816fa4157dab81aac1adc527029b18"

Odinga, a major figure in Kenyan politics for decades who was once a political prisoner and ran unsuccessfully for president five times, died on Wednesday aged 80 in India, where he had been receiving medical treatment.

With thousands of his supporters on the streets from early morning, chaos erupted when a huge crowd breached a gate at Nairobi’s main stadium, prompting soldiers to fire in the air, a Reuters witness said.

A police source told Reuters that two people were shot dead at the stadium. KTN News and Citizen TV later said the death toll had increased to four, with scores injured. After security forces fired shots, police used teargas to disperse thousands of mourners, the two broadcasters reported, leaving the stadium deserted.

Earlier in the day, thousands of mourners briefly stormed Nairobi’s international airport, interrupting a ceremony for the president, William Ruto, and other officials to receive Odinga’s body with military honours. The incident prompted a two-hour suspension of airport operations.

Crowds also flooded nearby roads and tried to breach parliament, where the government had originally scheduled the public viewing.

Though mainly known as an opposition figure, Odinga became prime minister in 2008 and also struck a political pact with Ruto last year in a career marked by shifting alliances.

He commanded passionate devotion among supporters, especially in his Luo community based in western Kenya, many of whom believe he was denied the presidency by electoral fraud.

Many of Odinga’s mourners, who were not yet born in 1991 when Kenya became a multi-party democracy, paid tribute to Odinga’s efforts as an activist.

Felix Ambani Uneck, a university student, said at the stadium: “He fought tirelessly for multi-party democracy, and we are enjoying those freedoms today because of his struggle.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7df4bd2af1dff9697f795a611635dc9ad97dc6e/132_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c15217396dbb60335113ce12c8bce776"

On her first trip outside Kenya, Esther Njoki travelled to London, where she was invited to parliament to meet the defence secretary, John Healey, whom she urged not to delay the potentially years-long extradition process.

“We are hoping that before his time ends and they get out of government he will have achieved what he wanted to achieve in Agnes’ case,” she said, “and it will be good for him, and also for [Wanjiru’s] family, and the whole world, because everyone is watching.”

Njoki, 21, who acts as the spokesperson for Wanjiru’s family, added that she has noticed “a big change” in the approach from the UK since Labour came to power last year, and fears that progress in the case may stall under a different government.

“Before it was it was very hard for us even to engage,” she said. “We even never got a chance to engage with the UK authorities, but now it is easy even to get to meet with the secretary of state for defence. We appreciate that, we don’t take it for granted.”

Wanjiru, a 21-year-old hairdresser, disappeared after a night out in Nanyuki, Kenya in 2012. Her body was found several weeks later in the grounds of the hotel where she was last seen.

Last month, a Kenyan court issued a warrant for the arrest of a suspect in the case, named as Robert James Purkiss, a former British soldier, who has been charged by a Kenyan court with a single count of murder.

In order for the suspect to face charges in Kenya, an extradition request will first have to be received and authorised by the UK courts.

“I’m hoping that whatever we discussed, it will be put into consideration, and things will be fast-tracked, because there’s the extradition process that is ahead,” Njoki said.

“I believe … his hands are tied. He can’t do much because he might prejudice the criminal matter. But again, if there is political will, things might go faster. So we’re just hoping that things will be taken seriously and they’ll keep us updated as the family, and ensure that justice is served.”

Healey, who had urged the previous government to act in Wanjiru’s case while in opposition, also met the family in Kenya in April, becoming the first UK government minister to do so.

“We appreciate it, because it’s the second time, he’s a senior official. It’s hard to meet such people, so I appreciate the support that he always gives, and being willing to meet us and to listen to our grievances,” Njoki said.

“We don’t take it for granted, and I appreciate him because we are seeing things changing, and then even he’s the first minister to meet us for over 13 years.”

During her five-day visit, Njoki, who is studying communications at the University of Nairobi, gave media interviews to raise the profile of the case, and also appeared on a panel at the House of Commons.

She sat alongside speakers including Ben Keith, a barrister specialising in international law and extradition, and Tessa Gregory, the UK lawyer acting for Wanjiru’s family.

Njoki said she hoped her advocacy work would not only bring justice for her aunt, but improve the lives of women in Kenya. “This is a way of changing things, just small steps,” she said. “It’s a sign of hope that everything is possible. Despite where you come from, your background doesn’t have to define you.”

Healey said: “Six months since our first meeting in Kenya, I was pleased to welcome the niece of the late Agnes Wanjiru, Esther Njoki, to London, to reiterate our government’s steadfast support for her family’s long and painful fight for justice.

“I want to pay tribute to Esther, who is an extraordinary spokesperson for her family, and for women who have suffered violence.”

He added: “We reflected on the significant progress made in recent months, with the case file being handed to the director of public prosecutions in April and a charging decision being made last month

“Our government will continue to do everything we can to support the Kenyan investigation, secure a resolution to this case and finally bring peace to Esther and her grieving family.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d08201e7d7d59c50d15f76608f3a34e546dab7c/0_386_4000_3200/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eb364bd3884b97bbab77f381b9b8cac3"

Scientists point to rising temperatures.,"Iceland is no longer among the few places in the world free of mosquitoes. Scientists point to rising temperatures.

Mosquitoes were detected in Iceland for the first time this month, resulting in the country losing its status as one of the only places in the world without them. The findings were confirmed by the country’s national science institute on Monday.

This follows record-breaking heat this past summer, which has sped up the glacial melting in the country.

When were mosquitoes detected in Iceland?

On October 16, insect enthusiast Bjorn Hjaltason posted on a Facebook group Skordýr og Nytjadýr Á Íslandi (Insects in Iceland) that he had spotted mosquitoes in Kidafell, Kjos at dusk that day.

He said he had caught some using a red wine ribbon, a trap using sweetened wine as bait to attract insects. Kjos is a glacial valley around 52km (32 miles) northeast of the Icelandic capital Reykjavik.

Hjaltason sent the mosquitoes to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland, where entomologist Matthias Alfredsson confirmed they were indeed mosquitoes.

Which type of mosquitoes have been found?

Alfredsson identified the mosquitoes as belonging to the Culiseta annulata species. This cold-resistant species is native to the Palearctic, which refers to Europe, North Africa and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. The Cuilseta annulata are not known to carry disease, but are generally considered a nuisance.

“It has adapted to a rather cold climate, surviving the winter as an adult and then staying in shelter, such as outbuildings and basements. The fly stings but is not considered dangerous to humans as it does not carry any known infections in these areas,” a news release published by the Natural Science Institute on Tuesday stated.

Mosquito species that are well-adapted to cooler conditions and can survive winters as eggs or larvae do not tend to carry disease.

“However, their development is slower, their active season shorter, and most tropical diseases cannot complete their life cycle before cold weather sets in,” British entomologist Luke Tilley, from the Royal Entomological Society, told Al Jazeera. “Cooler regions, therefore, tend to have mosquitoes, but with lower disease risk.”

Why did Iceland not have any mosquitoes before?

There are more than 3,500 species of mosquitoes around the globe, and they can be found in most parts of the world, bar a very few, including Iceland and Antarctica.

Mosquitoes breed in shallow, stagnant bodies of water, which Iceland is, in fact, abundant with. Despite having many marshes and ponds, however, it has never had a native mosquito population.

This is because mosquitoes are cold-blooded, which means they thrive in warmer environments. Male mosquitoes also feed on flowers, which thrive in warmer temperatures.

“Warmer air and water speed up their growth, feeding and reproduction, and also allow disease‑causing organisms inside them to develop more quickly. Longer warm seasons mean more generations of mosquitoes each year, and changes in rainfall can create new pools and puddles for breeding,” Tilley said.

Iceland is generally cold throughout the year. Its average temperature varies from -1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to 11 degrees Celsius (52 degrees Fahrenheit) in the warmer months.

Mosquitoes lay their eggs during cold weather, and when the water thaws, the larvae hatch from the eggs. In Iceland, however, water typically freezes and thaws several times a year – making the landscape generally inhospitable for mosquitoes.

Before mosquitoes were spotted this month, the closest they had come to Iceland was in the 1980s, when biologist Gisli Mar Gislason spotted one inside his aeroplane that had arrived at Keflavík International Airport from Greenland. The mosquito is preserved at the Icelandic Institute of Natural History.

Why are mosquitoes appearing in Iceland now?

In a statement, the Natural Science Institute said it is unclear how these particular mosquitoes came to be in Iceland. However, it added: “It is likely that it was transported by freight. It is uncertain whether it has settled here permanently, but everything indicates that it can survive in Icelandic conditions.”

A growing number of new insect species are being observed in Iceland due to a warming climate and increased transportation, the institute said.

The country is warming at an unprecedented rate. In May this year, Iceland and neighbouring Greenland experienced record-breaking heat due to a persistent weather pattern that brought unusually warm air from the south. In May, temperatures recorded in Iceland were some 13 degrees Celsius (23.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1990-2020 average – 10 times higher than the average warming of 1.3 degrees (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) across the world as a whole.

The country’s glaciers have been rapidly melting, and are projected to lose about half of their volume by 2100, the country’s Vatnajokull National Park website states.

Are mosquitoes making new appearances in other parts of the world as well?

Yes. Warming temperatures are changing how mosquitoes behave in many parts of the world.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified the increase in insect-borne disease as one of the biggest health threats to humans associated with climate change.

“Warmer conditions can allow mosquitoes and the pathogens [diseases] they carry to survive in new regions, extending the potential range of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus,” Tilley said.

“International travel, trade and changes in land use also play a part. The key is careful monitoring and preparedness to prevent local transmission.”

In September 2023, the United Kingdom found the eggs of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the country for the first time near Heathrow Airport. Then, in August 2024, four Aedes albopictus eggs were found at a motorway service station in Kent. No further specimens were found on investigation.

The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for the spread of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes albopictus can also transmit diseases such as dengue and chikungunya.

European countries have reported increasing cases of mosquito-borne illnesses recently. Last year, Italy had more than 200 local dengue cases. France and Spain also reported cases of the disease. This year, France has recorded 500 cases of chikungunya.

Warmer countries that already have high rates of mosquito-borne illnesses are seeing a surge in numbers. In September this year, Bangladesh recorded the largest single-day rise in both deaths and hospital admissions from dengue fever when 12 people died and 740 new people were hospitalised in just 24 hours.

Besides increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall can also allow mosquitoes to thrive. The rain flushes mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae from areas in which they breed to new areas. If rainwater does not drain away properly, it leaves pools of shallow, stagnant water, which serve as ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

Tilley explained that besides the spread of disease, changing mosquito populations can also create shifts in the ecosystem. “More mosquitoes can benefit their predators such as bats, dragonflies and birds, but disease in wildlife may also rise,” he said.

Tilley added that these shifts in mosquito behaviour also allow insect scientists to study patterns in climate change, noting, “Insects like mosquitoes are valuable indicators of environmental change, helping insect scientists track how ecosystems respond to a warming climate.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Culiseta_annulata_02-1761223565.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has announced he will run for re-election next year, seeking a fourth nonconsecutive term.

Speaking during a state visit to Indonesia on Thursday, President Lula said he remains energised despite his age.

“I’m turning 80, but you can be sure I have the same energy I had when I was 30. And I’m going to run for a fourth term in Brazil,” Lula told reporters in a joint news conference with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.

He then turned to Subianto to deliver a quip: “I’m telling you this because we’re still going to see each other many times.”

Brazil’s constitution allows presidents to serve only two consecutive terms. Lula, who served two terms in 2003-2010, returned to office in 2023 after 13 years out of power and thus remains eligible to run again.

The Brazilian leader is currently on a diplomatic trip across Asia. After his visit to Indonesia, Lula will head to Malaysia to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit.

While in Malaysia, Lula is expected to meet on Sunday with United States President Donald Trump, their first in-person encounter following a conciliatory phone call earlier this month, Brazilian media has reported.

The two leaders have clashed over the prosecution of former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro — an ally of Trump — and international trade.

Trump and Lula are expected to discuss the 50-percent trade tariff that Trump imposed on Brazil in August, in protest against the Bolsonaro prosecution.

Lula had previously said his 2022 presidential bid would be his final campaign, both because of his age and because he believed the country needed political renewal. That election saw him narrowly defeat Bolsonaro in a run-off.

But early in his current term — his third — Lula began hinting that he might run again.

In February 2023, the president said he could seek re-election in 2026, adding that his decision would depend on the country’s political context and his health.

A dominant figure on Brazil’s left, Lula is the country’s longest-serving president since its return to democracy 40 years ago.

Some Brazilian politicians have expressed concern about Lula’s age and recent health issues. He underwent emergency surgery to treat a brain bleed late last year after a fall in the bathroom. Still, Lula frequently insists he remains healthy and energetic, often sharing workout videos on social media.

Lula currently leads all polls for the 2026 election, though roughly half of voters say they disapprove of him. Trump’s tariffs reenergised the Brazilian leader and pushed his popularity up.

His main political rival, Bolsonaro, has been barred from running for office and was sentenced in September to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup.

While no strong opposition candidate has yet emerged, analysts say a viable contender is likely to depend on Bolsonaro’s backing as he serves his sentence under house arrest.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25296303630471-1761229772.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440
